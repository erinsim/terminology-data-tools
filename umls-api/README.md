# UMLS API Interface

This project provides a web-based interface for interacting with the UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) API. It allows users to search for medical terms, concepts, and codes from various vocabularies such as SNOMED CT, LOINC, ICD-10-CM, and more.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Search for terms, identifiers, or codes using the UMLS API.
- **Customizable Vocabularies**: Select specific vocabularies (e.g., SNOMED CT, LOINC) to narrow down search results.
- **Concept Details**: View detailed information about concepts, including atoms, relations, and definitions.
- **Raw Data View**: Toggle between formatted data and raw JSON responses from the API.
- **Recent Requests**: Display the most recent API request for reference.
- **Collapsible Sections**: Expand or collapse sections for additional information, such as API key instructions.
